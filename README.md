# ✈️ Flight Ticket Price Prediction – Machine Learning + Power BI Dashboard

This project predicts flight ticket prices using machine learning techniques and provides explainability and business insights through a dynamic Power BI dashboard. It combines data preprocessing, advanced modeling, performance evaluation, SHAP-based interpretation, and BI visualization.

---

## 📌 Project Summary

- 🔍 Performed data cleaning, transformation, and feature engineering on flight booking data.
- 🌲 Built and tuned machine learning models (Random Forest, XGBoost) to predict prices.
- 📊 Evaluated models using R², MAE, and RMSE for performance validation.
- 🔍 Applied SHAP to interpret model decisions and feature impact.
- 📈 Created a Power BI dashboard for visualization and business storytelling.
